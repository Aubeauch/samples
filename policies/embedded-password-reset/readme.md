# Sign-up and Sign-in with embedded password reset

By default when you create a sign-up or sign-in policy (with local accounts), you see a Forgot password? link on the first page of the experience. Clicking this link doesn't automatically trigger a password reset policy. Instead, the error code AADB2C90118 is returned to your app. Your app needs to handle this error code by invoking a specific password reset policy.

This policy demonstrates how to embed the password reset flow a part of the sign-up or sign-in policy. So, Azure AD B2C will not return the AADB2C90118 error message. For more information, see [Set up a password reset flow in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-password-reset-policy).
