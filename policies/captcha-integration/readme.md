### Scenario
This set of policies demonstrates how to integrate Google Captcha into the Sign In page.

* JavaScript is used to embed the Captcha control.
The Captcha response is inserted into a hidden field which the `SelfAsserted-LocalAccountSignin-Email` technical profile exposes to the sign in page.
* The `SelfAsserted-LocalAccountSignin-Email` technical profile retrieves the Captcha response from the hidden field and validates the blob against the Google servers using the `login-Recaptcha` validation technical profile. This technical profile is a REST API call to the Captcha API.
* If the response from the Google server is successful, B2C continues to validate the credentials against the directory using `login-noninteractive`. 
* Otherwise, the API responds back to AAD B2C indicating the Captcha was invalid and must try again. The error can be changed in the API source.
* Each time the user submits the page, the Captcha is reset using JavaScript.
